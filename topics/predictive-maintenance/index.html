AIT trains and applies machine-learning models to detect degradations of machines or machine parts, allowing them to predict future equipment failures. This provides an informed basis for proactive decisions by maintenance planning and can thus reduce the costs related to unexpected machine breakdowns. For example, maintenance can be brought forward, or additional resources can be requested. An additional cost saving occurs when maintenance is avoided for machines in a healthy condition.</p><h1 id=contact>Contact</h1></main></body></html>
