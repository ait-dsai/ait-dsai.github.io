Our solution supports LEAs in analysing, processing, and gaining information from large amounts of evidence data, such as video or audio recordings, pictures, and internet web pages. It deals with heterogeneity, varying quality of data acquired from a wide variety of data sources, and allows investigators to identify vehicles, weapons, sounds, sentences, and key words, and link them to relevant events.
Human operators are involved at many points along the different investigation phases, beginning with the data acquisition and selection, over the information extraction, to the assessment and decision support stage. Here it is key to reduce the need for human intervention and make use of the analystâ€™s expertise in the most efficient way.</p><h1 id=contact>Contact</h1></main></body></html>
