The historical data is used to build a mathematical model that captures important trends. The goal is to go beyond knowing what happened in the past, to providing a best assessment of what will happen in the future. We can then suggest actions to take for optimal outcomes. Predictive analytics is therefore a powerful tool for detecting fraud, predicting customer behavior, improving operations and reducing risk.</description></item><item><title>Predictive Maintenance</title><link>http://ait-dsai.github.io/topics/predictive-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2021 10:54:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://ait-dsai.github.io/topics/predictive-maintenance/</guid><description>Predictive Maintenance Predictive maintenance refers to a holistic approach to monitoring the history and condition of industrial equipment in order to determine when maintenance activities should be carried out. AIT trains and applies machine-learning models to detect degradations of machines or machine parts, allowing them to predict future equipment failures. This provides an informed basis for proactive decisions by maintenance planning and can thus reduce the costs related to unexpected machine breakdowns.</description></item><item><title>Home</title><link>http://ait-dsai.github.io/topics/network-analysis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2021 10:52:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://ait-dsai.github.io/topics/network-analysis/</guid><description>Network Analysis Network Security and Anomaly Detection AI can largely increase the detection accuracy of attacks and other threats flowing through the network and impacting end devices, without sacrificing the robustness of the analysis (i.e., false alarms). AI can also improve the automatic detection and diagnosis of the ever-growing number of anomalies occurring in all sort of complex systems, including data networks but not limited to that. By enabling the analysis of highly-dimensional data with both real-time and large-scale requirements, AI and big data principles and platforms can significantly improve the visibility and understanding of cybersecurity events and anomalies, empowering an efficient diagnosis process.</description></item><item><title>Consumer Protection</title><link>http://ait-dsai.github.io/topics/consumer-protection/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2021 10:47:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://ait-dsai.github.io/topics/consumer-protection/</guid><description>Consumer Protection Prevention is a key instrument in fighting cybercrime.

Yet most mainstream Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions simplify a task to a Machine Learning problem using a single sensory modality such as images or videos. By this, relevant information such as the audio layer of videos or the text of document images is neglected. Here at AIT, we focus on the complex task of harnessing and combining information from multiple modalities to develop higher-level cognitive AI systems.</description></item><item><title>Research | NLP</title><link>http://ait-dsai.github.io/research/nlp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:10:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://ait-dsai.github.io/research/nlp/</guid><description>Natural Language Processing Language understanding is a cognitive task at the highest level and a major discipline of artificial intelligence.
