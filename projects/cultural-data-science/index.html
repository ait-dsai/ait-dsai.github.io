AIT Cultural Data Science provides services and solutions to support digitalization in national libraries, archives, galleries, museums, as well as in academic humanities research.
Our research field has its roots in the turn of the century, at which time cultural institutions in Europe were beginning to digitize their holdings and make them available to citizens in digital form. Since then, DSAI Cultural Data Science has worked with institutions worldwide to support FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) access to cultural heritage, provide consulting services and data analysis expertise, and implement tailor-made software solutions based on open source technology. Partners in both research and commissioned projects including the European cultural heritage portal Europeana, the British Library, the Austrian Academy of Sciences, or the German Archaeological Institute.
Other topics include the long-term digital preservation, the application of machine learning for the analysis of digital cultural artefacts, and Culturomics â€“ the study of cultural phenomena through quantitative methods.</p></main></body></html>
