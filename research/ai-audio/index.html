This complex and diverse cognitive task is particularly relevant in security applications for the perception and interpretation of scenes, events and potential threats. At AIT, we focus on applied tasks such as acoustic scene interpretation and understanding, audio event detection in public and domestic environments as well as in media, anomalous sound detection, detection of audio manipulations, bioacoustics in medical applications, and the complex cognitive task of modelling subjective human perceptions such as emotions in speech and music.</p><h1 id=reference-projects>Reference Projects</h1><h1 id=contact>Contact</h1></main></body></html>
